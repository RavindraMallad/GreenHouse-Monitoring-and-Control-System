I developed an IoT-based automation system to monitor and control greenhouse conditions using a Raspberry Pi Pico W. The system utilizes sensors like DHT11 (temperature and humidity), soil moisture, and LDR (light-dependent resistor) to collect real-time data. Based on these readings, actuators such as a DC fan, water pump, and light bulb are controlled to maintain optimal conditions for plant growth.
